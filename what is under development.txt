🚧 Features Under Development / Incomplete


1. API Profile System
✅ Custom APIs can be created via GUI and saved as Python modules.

🔶 Missing validation on whether the generated Python API file actually works (e.g., syntax check, test import).

🔶 No UI for editing/removing custom APIs once added — only deletion works via context menu.

2. Session Management
✅ Sessions can be saved, renamed, and loaded based on chat mode.

🔶 No persistent syncing of renamed sessions if they’re edited from JSON directly.

🔶 No UI for manual session export/import.

🔶 Switching between sessions doesn’t reload attached files (minor UX issue).


3. Settings Panel
🔶 Placeholder for Settings button in sidebar, but the actual settings dialog is not yet implemented.

❌ No UI exists yet for toggling features, setting default API, customizing theme, etc.

4. Testing & Error Handling
⚠️ Minimal runtime validation when loading user-added code (custom API Python files).

⚠️ No error logging window/panel for debugging issues (e.g. traceback viewer).

⚠️ No unit tests or formal exception handling around user interactions or file reads.



🧠 Optional Features Not Yet Present (But Worth Considering)
Multi-message selection or deletion

In-app update check (for plugins/APIs/themes)

Notifications for long API responses

private chat option (not annoynimous, style change)

chat names should be auto renamed according to first message.
