💡 What Does FoxChat Do?
FoxChat lets users:

🤖 Chat with AI (AI Chat Mode)
Use multiple AI backends like OpenAI, Hugging Face, or your own custom APIs.

Add your own Python-based API integrations — no coding lock-in.

Customize and switch AI profiles directly in the app.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Chat Anonymously (Anonymous Chat Mode)
Start quick, local-only conversations without logging in or sharing data.

Great for personal journaling, note-taking, or sandbox experiments.
